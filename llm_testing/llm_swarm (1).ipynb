    "\n",
    "This guide provides a walkthrough for using [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/)'s Agents and [Ollama](ollama.coms)'s Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CrewAI** is a framework designed to automate various aspects of software development and maintenance. By using intelligent agents, CrewAI can handle tasks ranging from code review to optimization, significantly reducing the time and effort required from human developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ollama** offers a suite of local Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be integrated into various applications to provide advanced natural language processing capabilities. These models can be run on local hardware, offering a high degree of customization and privacy compared to cloud-based solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this guide, you will have a clear understanding of how to set up and utilize these tools to enhance your codebase. The process involves configuring AI agents to analyze, review, and suggest improvements to your Python code."
