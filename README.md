## Project Overview

### Description

This project aims to build code improvement software that utlizes an AI agent swarm using locally hosted models. There are three components to this project:

- A Python package that can be used as a CLI to perform refactoring tasks.
- A VSCode extension that uses the Python package to perform tasks based on inputs derived from the IDE.
- A [research notebook](research/llm_swarm.ipynb) that documents the process of building the AI agent swarm.

### Status

The package can be used as a basic CLI tool to perform refactoring tasks on input code. It can accept the input as a string, or as a file/folder of files. This CLI functionality is primarily for testing purposes as it is not expected

The VSCode extension allows the user to run the Python .

## Project Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.12.\*](https://www.python.org/) for running the Python package (as CLI or via extension)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for managing Python dependencies
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for running the VSCode extension
- [Node.js 16.13.\*](https://nodejs.org/en) for the VSCode extension
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for running the research notebook

> **_Note: a machine with a good GPU is highly recommended_**

### Development Setup

In terminal, in the root directory of the project, install the Python dependencies and pre-commit hooks by running the following commands:

```shell
poetry install --no-root
poetry run pre-commit install
```

Then navigate to `/vscode-extension` and install the required npm packages:

```shell
cd vscode-extension
npm install --save-dev \
  typescript \
  eslint@8.57.0 \
  @typescript-eslint/parser \
  @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin \
  globals \
  prettier
```

### Modules and Components

Breakdown of major modules and their responsibilities.

## Usage

### Python Package as CLI tool

```shell
# use -h to see args
poetry run cli
```

Alternatively, enter the virtual environment with `poetry shell` and then run `python main.py`, or simply run `poetry run python main.py`.

### VSCode extension

## Testing

There is a bash script in the root folder that runs the AI Crew on a set of test files found in `/python-package/tests/input`. Run it with:

```shell
./test.sh
```

# Running the extension

### cd into the vscode-extension directory

cd vscode-extension

# Create a python virtual environment for this project in a terminal

python -m venv venv

### Activate the virtual environment on Windows

.\venv\Scripts\activate

### Install nox in the activated environment

python -m pip install nox

### Run nox --session setup

nox --session setup - Note, you may have to install rust for this.

### Optional: Install test dependencies

python -m pip install -r src/test/python_tests/requirements.txt

### Install node packages

npm install

### Start running

Select 'Run' > 'Start Debugging' from the top menu. This should start both the extension and the language server.

## Developing the extension

See the README.md in the vscode-extension directory for more information on developing the extension.
